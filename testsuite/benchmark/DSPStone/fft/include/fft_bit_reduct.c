 *  description        : benchmarking of an integer stage scaling FFT
 *
 *                      To avoid errors caused by overflow and bit growth, 
 *                      the input data is scaled. Bit growth occurs potentially
 *                      at butterfly operations, which involve a complex 
 *                      multiplication, a complex addition and a complex 
 *                      subtraction. Maximal bit growth from butterfly input 
 *                      to butterfly output is two bits. 
 *
 *                      The input data includes enough extra sign bits, called 
 *                      guard bits, to ensure that bit growth never results in 
 *                      overflow (Rabiner and Gold, 1975). Data can grow by a
 *                      maximum factor of 2.4 from butterfly input to output
 *                      (two bits of grow). However, a data value cannot grow
 *                      by the maximum amount in two consecutive stages. 
 *                      The number of guard bits necessary to compensate the 
 *                      maximum bit growth in an N-point FFT is (log_2 (N))+1).
 *  
 *                      In a 16-point FFT (requires 4 stages), each of the 
 *                      input samples should contain 5 guard bits. The input 
 *                      data is then restricted to 10 bits, one sign bit and
 *                      nine magnitude bits, in order to prevent an
 *                      overflow from the integer multiplication with the
 *                      precalculed twiddle coefficients.
 *      
 *                      Another method to compensate bit growth is to scale the
 *                      outputs down by a factor of two unconditionally after
 *                      each stage. This approach is called unconditional scaling
 *                      
 *                      Initially, 2 guard bits are included in the input data 
 *                      to accomodate the maximum overflow in the first stage.
 *                      In each butterfly of a stage calculation, the data can 
 *                      grow into the guard bits. To prevent overflow in the next 
 *                      stage, the guard bits are replaced before the next stage
 *                      is executed by shifting the entire block of data one bit
 *                      to the right.
 * 
 *                      Input data should not be restricted to a 1.9 format.
 *                      Input data can be represented in a 1.13 format,that is
 *                      14 significant bits, one sign and 13 magnitude bits. In 
 *                      the FFT calculation, the data loses a total of (lg2 N)-1 
 *                      bits because of shifting. Unconditional scaling results 
 *                      in the same number of bits lost as in the input data scaling.
 *                      However, it produces more precise results because the 
 *                      FFT starts with more precise input data. The tradeoff 
 *                      is a slower FFT calculation because of the extra cycles
 *                      needed to shift the output of each stage.
 *
 *                      Input data is held on the include file "input16.dat"
 *                      or "input1024.dat" in float format (0 ... 1)
 *                      Data is transformed automatically to 1.Q fract format
